# Collabera
This repository contains a simple API testing implementation for the public endpoints provided by gorest.co.in.

## Files
Collabera.postman_collection.json – Main Postman collection

Collabera.postman_environment.json – Environment file containing baseURL and token variables

## Setup Instructions
Import both the collection and environment JSON files into Postman.

Set your personal access token in the environment variable named token.

Run the full collection or individual requests as needed.

## Implementation Details
When adding a new user, the script dynamically selects values for firstname, lastname, gender, and status from predefined arrays.

The user email is generated by combining the selected firstname and lastname along with a random number to ensure uniqueness. This approach is chosen instead of using Postman’s built-in firstname and lastname variables, to maintain the email as a direct combination of the user’s first and last names.

Both API calls include validation to check the API response status to ensure the requests succeed.

## Test Scenarios
Create a new user and verify the returned user ID is numeric.

Retrieve the first user and verify the user’s status is either "active" or "inactive".
